Testing for Supplemental Problem 3:

This problem has several variables that need a reasonable amount of
testing to make sure the program functions correctly in different scenarios.

variables to be changed are:

  /* the number of couples in the simulation */
  const int numberOfCouples = 60;

  /* number of children is recorded for sizes 1 .. maxRecordedSize */
  const int maxRecordedSize = 30;
  int famSize [maxRecordedSize + 1];

  /* the highest point of the histogram will have heightOfHistogram *'s */
  const int heightOfHistogram = 20;

white-box approach(based on code)

To begin, let us set all variables to the numbers given in the problem
(and above) to make sure the program yields expected output. Compile with
the line  gcc -o supProb3 supProb3.c.
test case 1:
program yields:

Simulation of family size for 60 couples
	family sizes truncated to 30
	maximum height of histogram: 20
	average number of children: 3.3
	max family size: 11

	family sizes

We see that this ran ohkay and the results look plausable.

For the variables we have now, lets test an important function of the
program, that is, the scaling of the histogram. 
a) change the heightOfHistogram variable to some smaller number
Test case 2: heightOfHistogram =15 :
numberOfCouple=30;

Simulation of family size for 30 couples
	family sizes truncated to 30
	maximum height of histogram: 15
	average number of children: 2.8
	max family size: 7

	family sizes
->note this works best if numberOfCouples<3*heightOfHistogram
(program ouput)

-> we see it prints correctly as before and prints correct number of rows 
(though for small heightOfHistogram some of the conditions fail to apply.

b) lets try a larger scaling
Test case 2: heightOfHistoram =30:

	maximum height of histogram: 30
	average number of children: 3.4
	max family size: 8

note if height of histogram > max_value less rows are printed.

Now lets test different values for numberOfCouples
a)  
Test case 3: const int numberOfCouples = 60;

	maximum height of histogram: 30

I know the program is correct because it meets requirement and tests well.
algorith for picking lines to print needs work
